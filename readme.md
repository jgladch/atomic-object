# Atomic Object Take Home Project

Due to the winter storm and extenuating circumstances, I didn't get to finish this project completely. It's still missing tests and a lot more work. Here are some basic instructions for getting it to work on Mac OS.

This is almost working, with work still needing to be done on the poly_checker.rkt

```sh
brew install racket
```

```sh
cd `project directory`
```

```sh
racket "main.rkt" "test/test_points.txt"
```

## Challenges

My main challenge on this project was getting familiar with the Racket language. Although the syntax is simple and straightforward, it took me a while to get up to speed on it. If this project was in javascript I probably could have completed it in just a few hours.

I also had some extenuating cicumcstances with the severe winter weather we had this weekend and did not get all the time I had budgeted to complete this project.
